## Fractional Knapsack Problem
- The problem of putting things in a backpack with a weight limit of k for maximum value  
	- Each object can be expressed as weight (w) and value (v)  
	- Since the object can be split, a part of the object can be put in a backpack, so it is called **Fractional** Knapsack Problem  
		- In contrast to the Fractional Knapsack Problem, there is also a backpack problem in which objects cannot be split into pieces (called 0/1 Knapsack Problem)  
#### C++
